GNU Freetalk 0.69
----------------

Freetalk is a console based Jabber client. It features a readline
interface with completion of buddy names, commands, and even ordinary
English words! Freetalk is extensible, configurable, and scriptable
through a Guile interface.

This is an alpha release, so not everything has been polished. However,
Freetalk works fine for basic usage.

GNU Freetalk is distributed under the GNU General Public License,
version 2 or later --- see the file COPYING for details.

-------------
INSTALLATION
-------------

You'll need Loudmouth 1.0, Guile 1.6, readline, Glib 2.0 and GNU Gettext
0.14.1 or later to compile Freetalk.

Get Loudmouth from http://developer.imendio.com/wiki/Loudmouth.
Debian users can just install the package libloudmouth1-dev.

You need to compile Loudmouth with SSL support for Freetalk to work.
For more details refer the Loudmouth README.

To compile Freetalk, do the standard dance:

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

The last command must be run as root. For further details about configure, see
the file 'INSTALL' in this directory.

--------------
USING FREETALK
--------------

To start with you can use Freetalk by just running 'freetalk' and
then doing /login to specify your Jabber account and password. To
avoid having to do this every time, you can put your account details
in a file called ~/.freetalk/freetalk.scm. Look at examples/freetalk.scm
to know how to do this.

There is comprehensive documentation in Info format in the doc/ directory,
which you should be able to read by saying,

$ info -f freetalk.info
